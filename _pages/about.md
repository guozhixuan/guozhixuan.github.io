Hello! Iâ€™m Zhixuan, an MPhil student at the Urban Governance and Design (UGOD) Thrust of [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in the fields of corporate governance, strategy, and corporate social responsibility, emphasizing sustainability and ESG practices. I also delve into business, urban, and environmental economics, considering their interplay with entrepreneurship. 

In my research, I explore how organizations make decisions, adapt, and respond to our evolving world, particularly when confronting challenges like climate change and the demand for sustainable development. Methodologically, I combine different theoretical and empirical techniques, ranging from causal inference and advanced data analytics to perspectives derived from theories like the resource-based view. With an ever-curious mindset, I remain receptive to new research topics and methods.

I am currently seeking a spot in a distinguished doctoral program, driven by a passion to address pressing academic challenges and enrich current research. Eager to collaborate with peers, I aim to meld theoretical insights with practical solutions, furthering both academic discourse and real-world impact.
