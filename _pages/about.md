About me
======
Hello! I’m Zhixuan, an MPhil student at the Urban Governance and Design (UGOD) Thrust of [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in the fields of corporate governance, strategy, and corporate social responsibility, emphasizing sustainability and ESG practices. I also delve into business, urban, and environmental economics, considering their interplay with entrepreneurship.

In my research, I seek to understand how organizations make decisions, behave, and adapt to our changing world — especially with challenges like climate change and the need for sustainable development. Methodologically, I combine different theoretical and empirical techniques, ranging from causal inference and advanced data analytics — sourcing from text and satellite images — to perspectives from theories like the resource-based view. With an ever-curious mindset, I remain receptive to new research avenues.

As I aspire to join a doctoral program, my goal is to identify and address pressing issues in our field, synthesize current research to further academic discourse, and collaborate with fellow scholars to drive both academic insights and practical solutions in our shared domains.
