I took on the role of Teaching Assistant (TA) for the interdisciplinary project, "Inspiration Lab: Escape from the Information Cocoon." Utilizing design thinking principles, I guided students through the creative process, ensuring they effectively tackled challenges and fostered innovative solutions. Beyond mentoring, I monitored their day-to-day activities, offering feedback and assigning grades based on their contributions and performance.
